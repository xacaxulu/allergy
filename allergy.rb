  # This project uses a concept called bitflagging where each new allergen
  # is a power of 2. If you want to see how this works, try using to_s(2)
  # to turn @flags into a binary string. `@flags.to_s(2) #=> 100010` when
  # @flags == 34. The first 1 is chocolate, the second 1 is peanuts. 32 + 2
  # == 34.
  # This works because even if all the allergens below 'cats' were active,
  # their total value would be 127. So we can ask what is the largest power
  # of two that fits in the allergy number.
